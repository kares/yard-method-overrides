                             YARD Method Overrides

  A YARD plugin that adds tags for specifying method overrides.  The tags added
  are @extension and @override, which allow you to tag a method as either an
  extension of a superclass’ definition or a complete override of a superclass’
  definition.  This makes it easy for the reader to see what’s going on may
  read up on what may be going on in the superclass.
